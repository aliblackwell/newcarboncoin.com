# New Carboncoin

The site is served using Github Pages and Amazon Cloudfront.

The 'develop' branch is where development work takes place.

The 'master' branch is production.

### Making changes

Check out this guide to understand the Github Flow:

https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

To make changes, create a new branch (based off master) using the dropdown menu on the repository homepage. Call it 'your-name/what-you-are-updating'.

Make your changes and commit them into your branch.

Once you are finished, create a pull request into the master branch. All Pull Requests need to be reviewed! Once your branch has been merged into the master branch, it will be live.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages
